# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Writeup

In this project main.cpp listens to data from the term 3 simulator and uses trajectory and sensor fusion information to plan a path along the map. 

Main.cpp provides a path to the simulator in the form of x and y coordinates that the simulator will visit in 20 ms increments. As finding an optimal path can take longer than 20 ms the provided path may be slighty outdated when it is sent to the simulator. Hence information form the last provided path is used in the current path in order to provide a smooth transition between outdated and new paths.
The more past path information is used, the smoother the transition. However, when using more outdated information there is a risk that recent changes (e.g. other vehicle's speed or lane changes) are not considered in time.

The c++ code reads a CSV file with waypoints that provide x,y and Frenet coordinates along the road path. As the track is approx. 7km long and only 181 waypoints are provided it is necessary to interpolate between waypoints, using the suggested Spline library.


Intermediate points are calculated using splines as shown in the walkthrough video. Speed is controlled by setting a reference value that is increment with acceptable
acceleration values if no obstacles are present, up to a speed just below the speed limit. The segment of the walkthrough video that shows how to initiate lane-changes depending on distances for cars in front is used as starting point for some more functions contained in change.cpp that help finding the best lane and checking if switching lanes is possible.


If the car encounters a slow moving vehicle in its own lane within a certain distance it tries to switch lanes if possible:
- the ego-vehicle will try to maintain a safe distance to the leading vehicle by using distance to leading vehicle in Frenet coordinates as input to a PID controller. It identifies the closest vehicle in the same lane and maintains a distance of 20 meters.
- the ego vehicle will check other lanes by getting the minimum speed of vehicles in front per lane, unless a lane-change was performed recently
	- the car will try to change into an adjacent lane if the minimum speed there is higher than in its own lane
		- if the car is in center lane it will try to pick the faster of the two remaining lanes
		- if the car is in the right or left lane it will switch to the adjacent lane if the speed there is better
		- if the car is in the right or left lane and the speed in adjacent lane is worse, but the speed in the far lane 		 is much better it will still try to switch to the adjacent lane (and then re-evaluate in the next cycle)
	- for the target lane the following feasibility test is performed:
		- for each car in target lane extrapolate position, extrapolate own position based on remaining points in path      		    sent to simulator
		- get distance to car based on current and extrapolated positions
		- if no cars are within these two distances the target lane is returned to main.cpp for execution, otherwise the 		current lane is returned

A simple function to check for lane changes of other cars is used to increment the timer that prevents lane changes of the ego-car. This could not be tested well as lane-changes by other cars did not occur frequently.

Some tuneable parameters are the range up to which vehicles in front are considered for the minimum lane speed as well as the safety distance before lane changes. The controller probably also needs some tuning.


   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
